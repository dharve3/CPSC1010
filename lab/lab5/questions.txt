NAME: Dylan Harvey

---------
example.c
---------
1) What is the cause of the seg fault in the program called example.c?
The for loop on line 10 attempts to read and add data outside the bounds of the array data, which has a size of 5.


--------
broken.c
--------
2) What line in broken.c did the program seg fault on?
Line 28

3) What was the value of the variable "count" at the time of the seg fault?
10

4) What was the value of the variable "i" at the time of the seg fault?
429

5) What was the value of the variable "search" at the time of the seg fault?
1

6) What are the values in the "table" array?
5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26

7) what do you think the bug is?
The while loop is using assignment instead of checking if search is equal to 1,making the loop endless, and exiting the bounds of the array.
